                In 2018, I was deployed to the USS Green Bay(LPD20) as a rider. This was quite an experience because on this trip I not only met my boyfriend, but I also got to become a shellback
                and head over to beautiful Cairns, Australia to do some snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef!

                Becoming a shellback is a navy tradition that I find quite gratuitous and unnecessary. It involves a series of degrading tasks that 'wogs' (sailors who have never crossed
                the equator on a naval vessel) do to prove their worth as shellbacks when a ship crosses the equator. I try to not give weight to the title of
                'shellback,' which only validates these types of traditions... nevertheless, in Navy circles, it is possible to milk some benefits in social situations that you wouldn't normally have access to, so I do cash in on being a shellback from time to time.

                Snorkeling on the Great Barrier Reef was the cool part of this deployment. Unfortunately, however, due to climate change, there isn't really much left of the GBR to enjoy. The parts
                we did see looked like a forest fire had gone through underwater with how bleached and dead the coral was. Still, I feel stoked to have gotten to see some parts of it before
                it completely disappears.

                There's also something to be said for a person who would take an assignment like this where they could write about literally anything and decide to recount a Naval deployment.
                It really speaks to a level of brainwashing and a real lack of originality. Alas, I cannot come up with anything more interesting about my life on the fly, so here's my wanton
                recount of the only thing I can think to write multiple paragraphs about at the moment.
